/* (a)Create a class named  Movie  that can be used with your video rental business. The Movie  class should track the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating (e.g., Rated G, PG-13, R), ID Number, and movie title with appropriate accessor and mutator methods. Also create an equals()  method that overrides Object â€™s  equals()  method, where two movies are equal if their ID number is identical. Next, create three additional classes named Action ,  Comedy , and Drama  that are derived from  Movie.  Finally, create an overridden method named calcLateFees  that takes as input the number of days a movie is late and returns the late fee for that movie. The default late fee is $2/day. Action movies have a late fee of $3/day, comedies are $2.50/day, and dramas are $2/day. Test your classes from a main  method.   
(b)Extend the previous problem with a  Rental  class. This class should store a  Movie that is rented, an integer representing the ID of the customer that rented the movie, and an integer indicating how many days late the movie is. Add a method that calculates the late fees for the rental. In your main  method, create an array of type Rental  filled with sample data of all types of movies. Then, create a method named lateFeesOwed  that iterates through the array and returns the total amount of late fees that are outstanding.
